### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

There were 3 passions in my professional life so far: electronics, DataSource SKUs, and Python!

In 2022 I graduated from Yandex Practicum (Python developer) so my technology stack expanded to  
Python, Django, Django-REST-framework, pytest, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, PostgreSQL, MS-SQL, Git, Linux, nginx, Gunicorn, Docker, Docker-Compose, CI/CD, Yandex.Cloud  
and I feel very capable now :)
